# vue-split-grid

## IN DEVELOPMENT
Vue Split Grid is currently in development. Not all features of SplitGrid have been implemented and the usage of the components (which can be seen in `examples/App.vue`) is still subject to change.

Vue Split Grid is a wrapper for [Split Grid](https://github.com/nathancahill/split/tree/master/packages/split-grid): The spiritual successor of [Split.js](https://github.com/nathancahill/split), built for CSS Grid.
